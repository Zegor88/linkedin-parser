A career path you might enjoy, which perhaps hasn’t crossed your mind, could be **AI Product Manager or AI Solutions Architect**.Here’s why:1. **AI Product Manager**: You already work with advanced analytics, machine learning, and agent-based systems like LangGraph and CrewAI. This role would allow you to combine your deep understanding of data, product development, and market trends. You’d focus on developing AI-driven products that optimize workflows, which aligns well with your interest in call center automation and optimizing operator efficiency.2. **AI Solutions Architect**: This position would involve designing and implementing AI systems tailored to specific business needs. Given your experience with automation projects, especially in logistics and call centers, you’d excel in crafting custom AI models that solve practical problems in CPA marketing or supplement production logistics.Both of these roles combine your technical expertise with strategic planning, and they allow you to leverage your knowledge of emerging technologies, particularly in AI and blockchain, to drive innovation within businesses.Does this path spark any new interest or ideas for you?\"\"\"…more",
